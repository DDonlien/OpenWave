**Let the music, truly move with you.** OpenWave is an open-source project dedicated to creating a revolutionary home audio experience. We believe the future of ambient music should not be confined to "rooms," but should be a "human-centric," dynamic, flowing, and seamlessly immersive personal sound field.

---

## 🌟 Core Concept

In today's multi-room audio systems, music is bound to specific spaces. When you walk from the living room to the kitchen, the music doesn't follow. You have to switch it manually or turn up the volume across the house, which ruins the private and immersive experience.

**OpenWave changes everything.**

By integrating with advanced indoor positioning technology and smart home platforms, OpenWave perceives your location in real-time and intelligently transitions the audio between different speakers, like a "sound wave" that surrounds you. Wherever you go, you are always in the sweet spot.

### Visualizing the Flow

Imagine this scenario:

**1. You are in the Living Room:**
The sound is primarily coming from the speaker closest to you, creating a personal sound bubble.

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|  Living Room    |     |     Hallway     |     |      Study      |
|                 |     |                 |     |                 |
|    (( (🚶) ))    |     |      . . .      |     |                 |
|                 |     |                 |     |                 |
|    🔊 (Loud)    |     |    🔉 (Medium)   |     |    🔈 (Off)      |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
       Node A                Node B                Node C
```

**2. As you walk towards the Study:**
OpenWave detects your movement. It doesn't just abruptly switch speakers. Instead, it smoothly fades the sound from the Living Room speaker to the Hallway speaker, and then begins to activate the Study speaker. The "sound wave" moves with you.

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|  Living Room    |     |     Hallway     |     |      Study      |
|                 |     |                 |     |                 |
|      . . .      |     |    (( (🚶) ))    |     |      . . .      |
|                 |     |                 |     |                 |
|    🔉 (Medium)   |     |    🔊 (Loud)    |     |    🔉 (Soft)     |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
       Node A                Node B                Node C
```

This continuous, dynamic adjustment is what makes OpenWave a truly immersive experience.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🚶‍♂️ User-Centric Dynamic Playback**: Music follows the user's footsteps, automatically flowing through the home's speaker system.
* **🎶 Seamless Audio Transition**: Beyond simple switching, it creates a smooth "sound wave" effect by dynamically adjusting volume and EQ.
* **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Multi-User Support (Planned)**: Create independent, non-interfering personal sound waves for each family member.
* **🔌 Highly Extensible**: Centered around [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), it's natively compatible with thousands of sensors and devices in its ecosystem.
* **🔊 Flexible Audio Output**: Primarily designed for high-fidelity, low-latency wired systems like **Dante** to achieve the ultimate seamless experience. Also compatible with popular wireless protocols (e.g., Sonos, Chromecast) for broader accessibility.

## 🔧 How It Works

OpenWave's core is a decision engine that runs as part of a smart home platform like Home Assistant. This diagram shows the data flow:

```
                               +--------------------------+
[Various Sensors] -----------> | Smart Home Platform (HA) |
(mmWave, Wi-Fi, UWB, etc.)     +--------------------------+
                                           |
                                           | (User location, device states)
                                           |
                               +--------------------------+
                               |    OpenWave Core Engine  |
                               +--------------------------+
                                           |
                                           | (Play, pause, volume, EQ commands)
                                           |
+-----------------+           +-----------------+           +-----------------+
| Audio Node A    | <---------+ Audio Node B    | <---------+ Audio Node C    |
| (Living Room)   |           | (Hallway)       |           | (Study)         |
+-----------------+           +-----------------+           +-----------------+
```

1. **Perception**: Home Assistant collects raw data from sensors across the house (e.g., mmWave presence sensors, Wi-Fi device tracking, UWB in the future).
2. **Decision**: The OpenWave engine analyzes this data to pinpoint user locations and calculates the desired state for each audio node based on pre-defined audio strategies.
3. **Execution**: The engine sends commands via Home Assistant to the audio nodes, controlling playback, pause, and real-time volume/EQ adjustments to achieve a smooth audio flow.
